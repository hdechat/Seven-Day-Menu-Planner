Two input fields for new photos to put in the album
One for the title of the photo
One for the caption of the photo
One input field to upload the photo (hint: look at the different HTML input element type attributes and how you can use on of them to select a file from your computer)
This article can help you with styling the file upload button
One “Add to Album” button for adding the photo to the album so you see it on the page
A section for all of the photos in the album to live

When a user fills in the Title, Caption, selects an image file from the photos directory, and then clicks the “Add to Album”, the photo should be added to the photo album.
Each photo, when added to the album, is placed in a “card”, and each photo card should display:
The photo
The title of the photo
The caption of the photo
A button to mark the photo as a “Favorite”
A button to “Remove” the photo from the album
The application should be responsive and work equally well on desktop and mobile
When the user clicks on the “Favorite” button, the photo card background turns (a different color), and the button should stay in the active (pink) state
When the user clicks on the “Remove” button, the photo should be removed from the page
